# Netlify redirects file for SPA routing
# This tells Netlify to serve index.html for all routes that don't match static files
# so React Router can handle client-side routing

# Redirect all routes to index.html with a 200 status code (SPA fallback)
/*    /index.html   200

# Optional: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS (if you want to enforce HTTPS)
# http://ip.rollingradius.com/*    https://ip.rollingradius.com/:splat  301!

# Optional: API proxies (if you need to proxy API calls to avoid CORS)
# /api/*  https://35.244.19.78:8042/:splat  200
